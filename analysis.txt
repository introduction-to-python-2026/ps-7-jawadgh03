I used the Iris dataset from sklearn
I chose sepal length and petal length as features.
I created a scatter plot to see the relationship between them.
The plot shows a positive correlation.
When sepal length increases, petal length also increases.

I used ChatGPT to help me with this assignment,but I understand the basics.
